# ![RealWorld Example App](../../logo.png)

> ### Java codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Java** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Java** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

It's a simple Java Spring Boot 3 application. 

The openapi specification has been faithfully translated to dto, entity and endpoint classes.

Security has been handled via Spring Security 6.

Database access is done via JPA and Hibernate.

Mappings have been done via MapStruct.

Endpoints are handled via Spring MVC Rest Controllers.

----
Tests are only done to showcase both unit and integration tests.
